### Tanishq Kumar Prasad

Welcome to my homepage! I am a student of **Statistics** at the *Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata*.  
I completed my undergraduate studies this year (2025) and am preparing for my Masters.

I am primarily interested in various aspects of **Time Series Analysis**, **Machine Learning**, **Stochastic Processes**, and **Non-Parametric Statistics**.  
I aim to pursue research in Statistics in the near future, though I have not narrowed down my interests yet. I have an inclination towards theoretical work and enjoy studying various topics with appropriate rigour.

### Purpose of this Website

This website was created with the purpose of disseminating knowledge on topics in statistics I've enjoyed throughout my undergraduate years.  
You’ll find:

- Rigorous write-ups on undergraduate-level statistical topics
- Some unpolished, downloadable reading material I prepared from time to time as an undergraduate (often collaborating with classmates),
  which one might find useful as a B. Stat student
   

This is a **work in progress**. I (almost surely) won’t update it during semester time, but I hope what’s here proves useful.
