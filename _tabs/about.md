## About Me

![My Profile Image](/assets/img/pfp.jpg){: width="150" style="float: left; margin-right: 15px; border-radius: 50%;"}

I am a Bachelor of Statistics (2022-2025) graduate from Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata. I aim to pursue research in Statistics in the near future, though I have not narrowed down my interests yet. Some areas which I have come to like while exploring are Machine Learning, Time Series Analysis, Stochastic Processes and Non-parametric statistics. I have an inclination towards theoretical work, and enjoy studying various topics with appropriate rigour.

## Purpose of this website

This website was created with the purpose of disseminating knowledge about various areas of Statistics which I have enjoyed throughout the years. It will mostly include rigourous write-ups regarding various topics which one might be interested in as an undergrad. Some reading material made by me during my undergrad will also be uploaded, but those will not be very organized; just certain documents one might find useful. This is a work in progress and will take a lot of time and effort; hence I will almost surely not be updating it during my semesters.
