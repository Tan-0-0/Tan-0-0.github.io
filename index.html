  ### **Tanishq Kumar Prasad**

  Welcome to my homepage! I am a student of **Statistics** at the **Indian Statistical Institue, Kolkata**. I completed my undergraduate studies this year (2025)
  and am preparing for my Masters.

  I am primarily interested in various aspects of **Time Series Analysis**, **Machine Learning**, **Stochastic Processes** and **Non-Parametric Statistics**. 
  I aim to pursue research in Statistics in the near future, though I have not narrowed down my interests yet.  I have an inclination towards theoretical work, and enjoy studying various topics with appropriate rigour.

  ## **Purpose of this website**

  This website was created with the purpose of disseminating knowledge about various areas of Statistics which I have enjoyed throughout the years. It will mostly include 
  rigourous write-ups regarding various topics which one might be interested in as an undergrad. Some reading material made by me during my undergrad will also be uploaded, 
  but those will not be very organized; just certain documents one might find useful. This is a work in progress and will take a lot of time and effort; hence I will almost surely
  not be updating it during my semesters.
